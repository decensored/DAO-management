## DAO brainstorming [work in progres!]

This DAO should handle it self without a true leader anyone can propose new stuff or change stuff by crating a Proposal. The rules (timing, possible answer, etc. are written down in the constitution. 

### Constitution -> Github?

how do the votings work
##### Proposal
Any Member can propose 
it must be announced on discord in #voting-alert and there has to be time to discuss it in the community

##### Answer Options:

there are 4 answer options for proposals:

- A: Yes
- B: No, but I like the idea, it needs minor change for a Yes
- C: No, but I agree that we need a solution for that problem, much brainstorming required
- D: discard

If yes wins against all other 3 togehter (A > (B+C+D) -> Proposal is accepted, and it will be done
If Discard win against all other 3 togheter (D > (A+B+C) -> Proposal discarded, DAO don't likes this idea
If "Yes" and "discard" both don't win -> (A+B VS C+D) -> check if big change of proposal is necesary

writer of proposal states prevoting, what the plans are if "minor changes" wins and if "big change needed" wins

### Manage Tasks and Goals -> github?

should we try out miro? are there free alternatives?

#### what do we need?
#### what do we want?

### New member
Right now everyone who introduces himself on discord and has asked to join our DAO on soonaverse gets the soonaverse role 


## Code


### IOTA DID
A User can use IOTA DID to link his messages to his account, and this DID gives him and only him the possibility to delete the message out of the core.

The Frontends use IOTA DID in order to log in to them. 

- Message not deletable if One looses access to his IOTA DID
-  Plan for IOTA DID implementation -> 1 Human 1 Account but is still able to be anonym. Alternatively, one root identity could have many different pseudonyms. Such that the owner of the group of identities sees them all but from outside there is nothing linking the different accounts. Of course, anyone can start a new identity, nothing can stop them, and people will do so for various reasons. But one root identity -> many different pseudonyms makes for easy management.
- What will be the requirements for the different frontends and who will be allowed to develop those? Anyone should be able to do anything with the code, but whatever they develop should add to the ecosystem.
- How conversations are moderated is a big challenge. Spam will happen, so even by that simple metric it has to happen. But that lets the genie out the bottle. Moderation must be transparent so users can gauge effectiveness and fairness. And then, there are many different conversations so nodes with poor moderation can be abandoned in favor of those with good moderation.

### We can Use TangleHub beta
We can store data decentral there


## Money

### Community Token?

we have a community token which could be offered for completing awards and airdropped by proposel (e.g. member xxx did hard work for DAO, let us give him y Token) -> then voting. legal has to be worked out

#### NFT?

we sell NFT available only with community token

we sell NFT which grant community token airdrop (like soonanauts and DAObee)
